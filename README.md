# Assessment for Overstock.com

This project is the Beer web application I was required to build for Overstock.com. It's made with **React + Redux**, as well as several libraries, SCSS, and it's fully responsive.

The application shows a list of beers consumed from a public [API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2), and each item allows the user to mark or unmark that bear as favourite by clicking the little start button on the bottom left corner of the box. It's also possible to view details from that item, by clicking the "View Details" button located on the bottom right corner.

Favourites beers are located in the right sidebar and, of course, it allows to remove items too.

Since the focus of this assessment is not the design, It may not be pretty enough, but looks pretty decent.

## To run the project:

1. Clone this repository
2. `$ npm install` or `yarn`
